# 🛠️ Support Chat UI

> 🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://support-chat-ui-theta.vercel.app](https://support-chat-ui-theta.vercel.app)
> ⚠️ **Note:** AI responses may take a few seconds to generate, as the backend uses a free-tier DeepSeek model via Together.ai.

## 💬 Overview

**Support Chat UI** is a customer support dashboard inspired by **Intercom**, a leading platform in chat-based customer service.
This project replicates key features that help support agents handle customer queries more efficiently using AI-powered assistance.

---

## ✨ Features

### 👨‍💻 Agent-Centric Design

* You play the role of an **agent** handling customer support requests for multiple brands.
* The UI is designed to prioritize agent workflows — from viewing customer chats to sending polished responses.

### 🤖 AI Copilot Integration

* As soon as a **customer message arrives**, the **AI Copilot** begins analyzing and drafting a suitable response.
* **For demo purposes**, the **customer messages are also generated by AI**, simulating realistic customer queries.
* Agents can:

  * View AI-generated replies in a **Copilot Sidebar**.
  * Instantly **add the AI's response** to the message composer with one click.
  * Ask the AI to **tweak responses**, such as changing tone or paraphrasing.

### 🧠 Smart Composer Tools

* Once the response is in the composer:

  * Agents can **select text** to format it — **bold**, *italic*, etc.
  * Access **AI-powered enhancements** via a toolbar:

    * Paraphrase text
    * Change tone (e.g., more polite, more professional)
    * Reword content for better impact

### 📱 Mobile Responsive

* Fully optimized for mobile devices:

  * The **customer list sidebar** and **AI Copilot panel** are hidden by default to maximize chat space.
  * Tap the left **arrow** to toggle the customer inbox.
  * Tap the right **"Show Copilot"** button to open the AI assistant panel.
